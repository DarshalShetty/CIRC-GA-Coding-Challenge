Phase I deployment of Hive is a fulfillment of a recent $3.7 million Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award to Georgia Tech from the National Science Foundation (NSF) with GT contributing $1.6M ($850K from VPR and $750K from PACE) towards the cost of the cluster. Phase II of Hive, scheduled to begin in 2020, will provide resources to users external to Georgia Tech, thus extending our services nationwide via XSEDE, in which we will dedicate 20% of the Hive’s compute cycles to researchers across the nation. XSEDE is a national network of NSF supercomputers that scientists and engineers use to interactively share computing resources, data, and expertise. Hive cluster is hosted at the state of the art Coda Data Center at Tech Square, which opened in Spring 2019.</td>
