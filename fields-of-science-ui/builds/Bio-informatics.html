                <td>The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) project facilitates primarily access and use of National Science Foundation (NSF) funded High Performance Computing (HPC) resources by neuroscientists and in addition the NSG team is interested in and exploring incorporation of High Throughput Computing (HTC) and academic and commercial cloud computing resources. Computational modeling of cells and networks has become an essential part of neuroscience research, and investigators are using models to address problems of ever increasing complexity, e.g. large scale network models and optimization or exploration of high dimensional parameter spaces. Similarly processing of experimental data (EEG, MRI, fMRI etc.) increasingly require compute power of HPC and can utilize HTC and cloud. NSG catalyzes such research by lowering or eliminating the administrative and technical barriers that currently make it difficult for investigators to use HPC resources. It offers free computer time to neuroscientists acquired via the supercomputer time allocation process managed by the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) Resource Allocation Committee (XRAC). NSG provides access to popular neuroscience tools, pipelines, data processing software etc. installed on various computing resources. It also provides a community mailing list for neuroscientists to collaborate and share ideas.</td>

                <td>Searching the SRA was the brainchild of Rob Edwards at San Diego State University. As a pioneer of metagenomics, Rob was frustrated that most of the DNA sequences that were publicly available were not searchable or useable, and he couldn’t find crAssphage in any of them. He started by exploring the SRA to find out where that phage was hiding.

Rob and graduate student Kyle Levi teamed up with JetStream, part of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment supported by the NSF to provide the compute resources required to search through the SRA. With an initial trial allocation of compute resources, Rob was able to identify thousands of metagenomes that contain crAssphage. As soon as Rob described this approach, other people wanted to search their data against the SRA, and so Rob needed a solution that didn’t involve his email!

Taking advantage of the XSEDEs Extended Collaborative Support Services (ECSS), Rob teamed up with Eroma Abeysinghe from SciGP team who deployed and configured the gateway front end and Mats Rynge who developed the back end of the search system.

The computation is provided through grant number TG-MCB170036 from XSEDE. This work used the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which is supported by National Science Foundation grant number ACI-1548562.
